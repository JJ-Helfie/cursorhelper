# Cursorhelper

This simple script will download and install cursor server binaries based on version information pasted from "about" dialogue in cursor.
By default it reads from STDIN, so just run the script, paste the about info and press ctrl-d and it should download and install the cursor remote server.

If you want stuff like the links in Azure thingies to work, register cursor as a handler for vscode:// in your operating system.
